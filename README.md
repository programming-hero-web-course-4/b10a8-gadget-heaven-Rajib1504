<h2>List of React Fundamentals Used</h2>
<p>This project demonstrates various fundamental concepts of React, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>React Router:</strong> Used for creating a single-page application (SPA) with routes for different pages. Components like <code>createBrowserRouter</code>, <code>Navigate</code>, <code>NavLink</code>, and <code>Outlet</code> help manage navigation.</li>
    <li><strong>Component Structure:</strong> The project is divided into reusable components such as <code>Home</code>, <code>Dashboard</code>, <code>Wishlist</code>, and <code>Cart</code>. Smaller UI components like <code>GadgetsCards</code> and <code>CartList</code> promote modularity and separation of concerns.</li>
    <li><strong>State Management with useState:</strong> <code>useState</code> manages local states, including <code>cartList</code>, <code>wishlist</code>, and <code>totalCost</code>. Enables real-time UI updates based on user interactions.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Fetching with useLoaderData:</strong> <code>useLoaderData</code> from <code>react-router-dom</code> is used to load data when routes are accessed, ensuring data is available for rendering.</li>
    <li><strong>Side Effects with useEffect:</strong> <code>useEffect</code> manages tasks like setting document titles and loading data on component mount.</li>
    <li><strong>Conditional Rendering:</strong> Elements like the "Purchase" button are conditionally rendered to improve user experience.</li>
    <li><strong>Props for Data Passing:</strong> Data is passed between parent and child components using props, ensuring a structured data flow.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Management</h2>
<p><strong>Local Storage</strong> is used for data handling and persistence in this project:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Storing Cart and Wishlist Data:</strong> Functions such as <code>addToCart</code> and <code>storeCartRemove</code> interact with local storage to keep cart and wishlist data saved. This allows users to retain their selections even when they refresh the page or close the tab.</li>
    <li><strong>Fetching Data on Load:</strong> Functions like <code>getFromCart</code> and <code>getFromWish</code> retrieve stored data when components mount, ensuring the cart and wishlist maintain saved data for a smooth, uninterrupted experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Features of Gadget World</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Dynamic Category Filtering:</strong> Users can select categories to filter items dynamically, displaying only the products that belong to the chosen category.</li>
    <li><strong>Cart Purchase Functionality:</strong> Users can add items to the cart and make a "Purchase All" action to buy all items in one click, making shopping more convenient.</li>
    <li><strong>Wishlist Management:</strong> Products can be added to a wishlist, and the data persists through local storage, allowing items to remain in the wishlist across sessions.</li>
    <li><strong>Persistent Data Storage:</strong> Using local storage, usersâ€™ cart and wishlist data persist even if they close the tab. This ensures data is available when they return.</li>
    <li><strong>Smart Navigation Styling and Item Limiting:</strong> The navbar changes color based on the current route, enhancing navigation clarity. Additionally, users cannot add the same product multiple times, preventing duplicate entries in the cart.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Notes</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Gadget World</strong> utilizes modern React concepts to offer a user-friendly and interactive experience. With responsive design, real-time notifications, and smart data management, it provides a seamless shopping experience.
